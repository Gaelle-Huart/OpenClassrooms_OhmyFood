## FAQs
A list of frequently asked questions:
1. **Can I use OhmyFood anywhere?**
Yes you can use it anywhere but be aware that the restaurants are in Paris. You must be within the city to actually enjoy what you paid for.
2. **Do I have to register myself to use OhmyFood?**
No, there is no need for registration to use our website.
3. **Is there a refund policy?**
No, once your command is paid, the restaurant receiving it does prepare it. If an unforseen event prevented you from enjoying it then the restaurant or OhmyFood cannot be blamed for it, thus your money is lost.
